### Galaxy Playlist Generator

In this challenge, you'll combine your knowledge of JavaScript arrays and the `map()` function to create a personalized "Awesome Mix" playlist for each of the Guardians of the Galaxy. The task is to filter and organize songs based on each Guardian's musical preference, displaying a playlist tailored just for them.



#### What I did:

1. **Expand the Songs Array**: Add at least five songs to the `songs` array, each with `title`, `artist`, and `genre`.
2. **Assign Preferences**: Complete the `guardians` object by assigning each Guardian their preferred music genre.
3. **Generate Playlists**: Implement the `generatePlaylist` function. Use the `map()` function to create a personalized playlist for each Guardian based on their genre preference.
4. **Display Playlists**: Dynamically create and append elements to the `#playlists` div to display each Guardian's playlist. Include the Guardian's name and their list of songs.
5. **Test Your Application**: Ensure that your application correctly filters songs by genre for each Guardian and displays the playlists on the web page.

#### Challenges:

- I stuggled to display the playlists on the webpage as there are so many compartments in the function.
- I found it quite challenging to break down the displayPlaylist function into smaller steps.

#### What I learned:

- Improving at writing pseudocode.
- Improving at problem-solving skills through having to debug my code.
